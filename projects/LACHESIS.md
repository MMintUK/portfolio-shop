  In the grand theatre of life, the Moirae pull the cosmic strings. Clotho, the string-spinner; Lachesis, the puppet master; Atropos, the ultimate string-cutter. Birth, life, and a snip-snip the finale – they're the maestros of the divine puppet show. No backstage passes; they control the strings!

In Greek mythology, the Moirae are the three goddesses of fate. Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. The three sisters weave the fate of humans and gods alike. Neither human nor God has the power to influence or question their judgment and actions! Clotho, the youngest one, spins the thread of life; she is the very origin, the creation of life itself and her thread is spun upon the birth of a person! Lachesis, the second sister, is the one that allocates the fate of people during life. The name comes from the Greek word ‘λαγχάνω’ ΑΓΧΆΝΩ which means to obtain from lots. In that sense, one can understand that their destiny is chosen out of a myriad of possibilities. It is said that Lachesis measures the thread of life with her rod, determining its length and nature. The last sister of fate is Atropos, the unturning. Atropos is the cutter of the thread of life and with her shears she determines how someone will die.
